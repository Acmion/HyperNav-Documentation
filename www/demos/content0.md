# Demos

On this page you can find a list of HyperNav demos.

## HyperNav Complete Demo

A demo that showcases the most of what HyperNav is capable of. Due to the complexity 
of HyperNav and the showcase nature of this demo, several elements behave differently 
from each other. For example, some buttons are "full buttons" and some are "split buttons".
Mixing different types of elements is not recommended in a real project. This demo is not
entirely keyboard accessible (or rather it is, but the fact that arrow keys must be used
is strange).

## HyperNav Natural Demo

A demo that is more keyboard accessible than the HyperNav Complete Demo. Due to the complexity 
of HyperNav and the showcase nature of this demo, several elements behave differently 
from each other, just like the HyperNav Complete Demo.

## HyperNav No JavaScript Demo

The demos above use JavaScript to provide theme switching logic and an IE11 CSS variable polyfill. This demo does
not use any JavaScript, otherwise it is the same as the HyperNav Complete Demo.

## Nested Iconified Side Navigation Menu (Full Button Demo) UI & UX Concept

This demo features a HyperNav side navigation menu, but is more of a UI & UX demo,
rather than a demo of HyperNav. The demo features only full expand items.

## Nested Iconified Side Navigation Menu (Split Button Demo) UI & UX Concept

This demo features a HyperNav side navigation menu, but is more of a UI & UX demo,
rather than a demo of HyperNav. The demo features only split expand items. Additionally,
some enhancing JavaScript (not bundled with HyperNav) is used to improve the user experience.
