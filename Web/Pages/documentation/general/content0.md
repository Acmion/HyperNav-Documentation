# General

This section documents HyperNav from a general perspective. This means that this content
is applicable for both the top and side navigation menu. Specific documentation for the 
side and top navigation can be found under their respective pages. 

**Note**: All examples under general us the class `hn-top` (the class for top navigation) due to 
more convenient presentation. The rest of the markup works for both side and top navigations.
